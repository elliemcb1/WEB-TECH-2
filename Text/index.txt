I'm Jo Smith, a passionate photographer born and raised in Dundee, Scotland. 
                With a degree in Photography and a deep love for the natural world, 
                I specialize in capturing the beauty of nature through my lens.
                Although nature photography is my true passion, I also take on general 
                photography work — including portraits, events, and commercial shoots — 
                to support my creative journey. 
                <br><br>
                I believe every photo should tell a story, and I strive to create images 
                that are both artistic and meaningful. When I’m not behind the camera, 
                I’m exploring Scotland’s scenic landscapes or meeting new clients around the city. 
                Whether you're looking to document a special occasion or need professional 
                photography for your business, I’m here to help. learn more about my story bellow
