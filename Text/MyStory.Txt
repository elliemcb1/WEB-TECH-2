     Photography has always been my way of connecting with the world — not just through
                    images, but through emotion, atmosphere, and the quiet stories that unfold in everyday moments. I’m
                    endlessly inspired by Scotland’s shifting light, rugged landscapes, and the raw beauty that lives in
                    both nature and people.

              My journey began with a second-hand camera and long walks through the Highlands,
                    chasing golden hour and misty mornings. Over time, what started as a hobby grew into a calling. I’ve
                    had the joy of working with families, couples, creatives, and small businesses — each shoot a
                    collaboration, each subject a new story waiting to be told.</p>

              I believe in authenticity over perfection. My style leans into natural light, candid
                    movement, and the kind of fleeting expressions that say more than words ever could. Whether I’m
                    photographing a windswept elopement on the Isle of Skye or a quiet portrait session in a Dundee
                    café, I bring the same sense of wonder and care to every frame.

             When I’m not behind the lens, you’ll find me hiking with my dog, editing in cozy
                    corners, or sipping strong coffee while dreaming up my next creative project. I’m always open to new
                    ideas, new faces, and new adventures — so if you’re curious about working together, I’d love to hear
                    from you
